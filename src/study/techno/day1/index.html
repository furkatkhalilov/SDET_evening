<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
    standard
    dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
    specimen
    book.</p>
</p>
<br>
<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
    essentially
    unchanged.
</p>
<p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
    recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
