    /*
       Absolute xpath -->      //*[@id="content"]/div/div[7]/div/div/div/div/div[2]/h2

            1) Absolute xpath is also called as single slash
            2) Absolute xpath is looking for the exact locatoin of the element so it is depends on the
        a lot of parents so thats why it is easy break.



        Relative xpath -->      //h2[@class='wt-text-heading-02 mb-xs-2']

            1) Relative xpath is also called as double slash
            2) It is working with attribues and it is more reliable then absolute xpath that is why
                    I am preferring relative xpath
